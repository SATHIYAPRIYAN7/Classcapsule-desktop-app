2. **Microphone Permission**:
   ```
   System Preferences > Security & Privacy > Privacy > Microphone
   ```
   - Add Chrome/Edge to the list
   - Restart browser

### Step 3: Test with Mac Test Page
1. **Open `mac-test.html`** in Chrome/Edge
2. **Run the Mac permissions test**
3. **Test screen recording**
4. **Check the debug console** for detailed logs

## 🔍 Detailed Troubleshooting

### Common Mac Error Messages & Solutions

#### "Screen recording permission denied"
**Solution:**
1. Go to `System Preferences > Security & Privacy > Privacy > Screen Recording`
2. Click the lock icon (bottom left)
3. Add Chrome/Edge to the list
4. Restart browser completely

#### "Failed to start recording"
**Solution:**
1. Check if another app is using screen recording
2. Close all other browser tabs
3. Try refreshing the page
4. Restart browser

#### "Audio recording failed"
**Solution:**
1. Go to `System Preferences > Security & Privacy > Privacy > Microphone`
2. Add Chrome/Edge to the list
3. Try recording without microphone first
4. Restart browser

#### "MediaRecorder error"
**Solution:**
1. Update Chrome/Edge to latest version
2. Try different browser (Chrome vs Edge)
3. Record without microphone
4. Check console for specific error

### Mac-Specific Code Changes

#### 1. Simplified Audio Configuration
```javascript
// Mac-optimized audio settings
audio: {
  echoCancellation: false,  // Disabled for Mac
  noiseSuppression: false,   // Disabled for Mac
  sampleRate: 48000         // Standard Mac sample rate
}
```

#### 2. Mac-Specific Recording Method
```javascript
async startRecordingMac() {
  // Simplified approach without complex audio mixing
  // Lower bitrates for Mac stability
  // Mac-optimized codec selection
}
```

#### 3. Better Error Handling
```javascript
// Mac-specific error messages
if (this.isMac()) {
  return 'Screen recording permission denied on Mac. Please:\n1. Go to System Preferences...';
}
```

## 🧪 Testing Your Mac Fix

### 1. Use the Mac Test Page
Open `mac-test.html` and:
- ✅ Check system compatibility
- ✅ Test permissions
- ✅ Verify screen recording
- ✅ Monitor debug console

### 2. Extension Testing
1. **Load your extension** in Chrome/Edge
2. **Navigate to any webpage**
3. **Click the extension icon**
4. **Try recording** - should work without errors

### 3. Debug Console Monitoring
Watch for these success messages:
```
"Using Mac-optimized recording approach..."
"Screen capture obtained on Mac:"
"MediaRecorder started successfully on Mac"
"Recording completed:"
```

## 🚨 Mac-Specific Issues to Watch For

### 1. **Permission Timing**
- Mac requires permissions to be granted BEFORE starting recording
- Restart browser after granting permissions

### 2. **Audio Context Issues**
- Mac has stricter audio handling
- Simplified audio mixing avoids these issues

### 3. **Codec Compatibility**
- Mac prefers VP8 over VP9
- Lower bitrates work better on Mac

### 4. **Browser Differences**
- Chrome works better than Edge on Mac
- Safari doesn't support screen recording

## 📋 Mac Setup Checklist

### Before Testing:
- [ ] Chrome/Edge updated to latest version
- [ ] Screen recording permission granted
- [ ] Microphone permission granted (optional)
- [ ] Browser restarted after permissions
- [ ] No other apps using screen recording
- [ ] Extension reloaded

### Testing Steps:
- [ ] Open `mac-test.html`
- [ ] Run system compatibility test
- [ ] Test permissions
- [ ] Try screen recording test
- [ ] Check debug console for errors
- [ ] Test with your extension

## 🔧 Advanced Mac Debugging

### Console Logs to Monitor:
```javascript
// Success messages:
"Using Mac-optimized recording approach..."
"Screen capture obtained on Mac:"
"Simple audio mixing completed for Mac"
"MediaRecorder started successfully on Mac"

// Error messages to watch for:
"Permission denied"
"NotSupportedError"
"AudioContext"
"Failed to start recording"
```

### Common Mac Error Patterns:
1. **Permission Issues**: Check System Preferences
2. **Audio Context Errors**: Use simplified audio mixing
3. **Codec Errors**: Try different browser or update
4. **Timing Issues**: Restart browser after permissions

## 🎯 Mac-Specific Optimizations

### 1. **Audio Settings**
- Disabled echo cancellation
- Disabled noise suppression
- Standard 48kHz sample rate
- Lower audio bitrate (96kbps)

### 2. **Video Settings**
- Lower video bitrate (2Mbps)
- VP8 codec priority
- Simplified audio mixing
- Longer chunk intervals (2 seconds)

### 3. **Error Handling**
- Mac-specific error messages
